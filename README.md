# Overview

In this assignment you are asked to program a BEM (Blade Element Momentum) model for one of two rotors:

 - A wind turbine, in axial and yawed flow
 - A propeller, in axial and yawed flow, in cruise (optional: and energy harvesting)  

NOTE: choose one of the two rotor cases for the mandatory assignment, If you wish, you can do both rotors.

The BEM code should incorporate the Glauert correction for heavily loaded rotors for the wind turbine case, and the Prandtl tip and root corrections. Assume a constant airfoil along the span and use the provided polars of the:

 - DU airfoil for the wind turbine
 - ARA-D 8% airfoil for the propeller

Discuss the different inaccuracies introduced into the solution by using a single airfoil polar only.
